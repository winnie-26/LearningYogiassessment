# Handover

## Architecture overview
- `cmd/app/main.go`: bootstraps server
- `internal/api`: Echo server, routing, handlers, middleware (JWT, rate-limit)
- `internal/service`: business logic (auth, groups, messaging)
- `internal/store`: DB access (sqlx)
- `internal/crypto`: key wrapping and AES-128-GCM for messages
- `internal/notify`: FCM integration
- `migrations`: SQL migrations for all tables

## Decisions
- AES-128-GCM for messages; AES-256-GCM for wrapping group keys with `MASTER_KEY`
- Structured logging via zerolog
- JWT access+refresh (to be implemented)
- Simulated realtime via immediate ack + FCM push

## Local run
- `docker-compose up --build`

## Next steps
- Fill handlers and services per spec
- Add unit and integration tests
- Document OpenAPI and export Postman collection

## AI usage
- Scaffolding and boilerplate were generated by AI assistant; all security-sensitive logic to be reviewed.
